# StreamFlow - Modular monolith
This is the repository of a modular monolith for the fictitious application "StreamFlow" from the subject "Arquitectura de Sistemas" at the Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte. All the necessary tools and commands to run the project are described below.

## Pre-requisites
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/es-es/download) (version 9.0.4)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (version 8.0.29) 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (version 2.49.0)

3. **Restore project dependencies**

4. **Create a ```.env``` file on the root of the project and fill the environment variables**
